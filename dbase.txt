Everything gets better with time, and time is forever.
Imagine! People are not volunteering to go to foreign countries and die the way they used to! Imagine that!
Every time I hear footsteps on the steps, my heart rate goes up. Every time I hear the clacking of high heels, I am seized with trepidation.
I think you need to have lived more to truly know a man's heart. You need to have made more transactions in life to know the worth of the coin you spend so freely.
May our house always be too small to hold all of our friends
Are we really sure, can a love that lasted for so long, still endure?
